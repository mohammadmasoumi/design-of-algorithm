## Variables

- variables as container to hold values
- introduce assignment operator
  > **the value** in the right side will be assigned to **the variable** in the left side
- swap the value of two variables with each other
  - with the assistance of a third variable
  - with the assistance of arithmetic operators
- variable properties
  - name
  - value
  - type

## Datatypes

- introduction to datatypes (real world exaample)
  - int/integet(age, number of apples)
  - float(weight, height, grade)
  - str/string(name, lastname)
  - bool/boolean(is disable, has disability)
  - list/array(list of students, list of ... )
- the rationale behind the various datatypes
- storing datatypes in RAM
- software layer - byte code and CPU instructions
- hardware layer - logical gates circuit
- bit/bits, byte/bytes
- binary conversion
  - 10 to bases and vice versa
  - 2 to 2^n and vice versa (direct conversion)
  - base 16
- binary arithmetic operation
  - 1' complement
  - 2' complement (HIGH LEVEL)
- ASCCI code
- static type vs dynamic type programming language

## Casting

- introduction to casting
- cast application

## Comment

- comment application
  - debugging
  - description/readability/explain
  - todo
- single line vs multiline comment

## Terminal

- introduce terminal - user interaction
- input(built-in function)
- print(built-in function)

### Arithmetic operators

- introduce arithmetic operators
  ```
  +, -
  *, / (floor div ), // (true div)
  pow, **, mod, %
  ```
- mod operator application (periodic patterns)
- math library, sqrt, abs, ...
- paranthesis priority

### Comparison operator

- introduction to comparison operator
  ```
  >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=
  ```
- string comparison
- comparison multi values
  ```
  a < b < c
  VS
  a < b and b < c
  ```

### Assignment operators

- introduction to assignment operators
  ```
  = , +=, -=, *=, /=, **=
  ```

### logical operators

- introduction to logical operators

  ```
  and, or, not
  &&, ||, !
  ```

- logical precedence
  - paranthesis
  - left to right
- execution
  ```
  condition1 and condition2
    if condition1 is false, condition2 won't check
  condition1 or condition2
    if condition1 is true, condition2 won't check
  ```
- truthy and falsy values

### Bitwise operators

- introduction to bitwise operators

  ```
  &, |, ^, ~ (!)
  ```

### Membership operators

- short introduction

### Identity operators

- short introduction

## Selecction statement
