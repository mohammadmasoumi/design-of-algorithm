## Datatypes

- introduce datatypes (real world exaample)
  - int(age, number of apples)
  - float(weight, height, grade)
  - str(name, lastname)
  - bool(is disable, has disability)
  - list(list of students, list of ... )
- the rationale behind the various datatypes
- storing datatypes in RAM
- software layer - byte code and CPU instructions
- hardware layer - logical gates circute
- binary conversion
  - 10 to bases and vice versa
  - 2 to 2^n and vice versa (direct conversion)
  - base 16
- binary arithmetic operation
  - 1' complement
  - 2' complement (HIGH LEVEL)
- ASCCI code

## Variables

- variables as container to hold values
- introduce assignment operator
  > **the value** in the right side will be assigned to **the variable** in the left side
- swap the value of two variables with each other
  - with the assistance of a third variable
  - with the assistance of arithmetic operators
- variable properties
  - name
  - value
  - type

## Simple input and output

- introduce terminal - user interaction
- introduce input (from the terminal)
- introduce print (to the terminal)

## Operators

- arithmetic operators
- comparison operator
- assignment operators
- logical operators
- bitwise operators
- membership operators
- identity operators

### Arithmetic operators

- introduce arithmetic operators
  - +, -
  - \*, / (floor div ), // (true div)
  - pow, \*\*, mod, %
- mod operator application (periodic patterns)
- math library, sqrt, abs, ...
- paranthesis priority
