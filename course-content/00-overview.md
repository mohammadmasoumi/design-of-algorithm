## Data Types

- introduce data types with example from real world
  - int
  - float
  - str
  - bool
  - list
- the rationale behind the various data types
- Storing values in RAM - bit/byte
- byte code
- software layer .... hardware layer, How hardware understand data types
- logical gates circute
- data types to byte code
- binary conversion
- 2 - 16 base
- base 2 -> base 4 stright way
  base 2 -> base 8
- str -> byte code ??
  - ASCCI code

## Variables

- introduce variables as container to hold values
- swap the value of two variables with each other
  - with the assistance of a thrid variable
  - with the assistance of arithmetic operators
- variable
  - name
  - value
  - type
- introduce assignment operator
- ## the value in the right side will be assigned to the variable in the left side

## Simple input and output

- introduce terminal
- introduce input (from the terminal)
- introduce print (to the terminal)

## Operators

- arithmetic operators
- comparison operator
- assignment operators
- logical operators
- bitwise operators
- membership operators
- identity operators

### Arithmetic operators

- introduce arithmetic operators
  - +, -
  - \*, / (floor div ), // (true div)
  - pow, \*\*, mod, %
- mod operator application (periodic samples)
- math library, sqrt, abs, ...
- paranthesis priority
